Convert to manual evaluation.
Inputting an expression doesn't evaluate it; it is stored as the "current
expression".
Evaluation is triggered by commands (new name for pragmas):

:n        ; reduce to normal form, if any
:s        ; one reduction step (outermost redex)
:sc S     ; reduce outermost S
:scn S 3  ; reduce third S, going depth-first
:u        ; undo last reduction
:mr <int> ; set cutoff for max # of reductions

With this, the language will truly be a combinator calculator.

**********

Convert expr2s back to exprs before printing.
Leave as expr2s while tracing.
