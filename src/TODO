**********

Modify literate programming syntax so code outputs are printed
with two spaces at the front.

Also modify so that input lines are printed in literate mode:

  > def I' (S K K)
  > (I' x)
  > :c :n

Need a "literate_syntax" variable.

**********

Commands to implement:

:scn S 3  ; reduce third S, going depth-first

**********

Add Y as a primitive combinator?
