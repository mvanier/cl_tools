Smullyan, _To Mock A Mockingbird_: Chapter 9, Problem 7.

== Definitions

normal(X) = exists x . (X x) = x.
happy(X) = exists x y . (X x) = y /\ (X y) = x.

== Problem

Given: normal(X).
Prove: happy(X).

== Solution

normal(X)
-> exists x . (X x) = x; call x -> x'
-> (X x') = x'
If x = x' and y = x', then (X x) = y /\ (X y) = x
(x and y do not need to be distinct)
QED.
