**********

Improve the definition syntax so I can write e.g.

```
def F = (K I)
def S (f g x) = (f x (g x))
def X (x) = (x K S K)  ; universal combinator
```

**********

Commands to implement:

:scn S 3  ; reduce third S, going depth-first

**********

Add Y as a primitive combinator?
Or as a built-in combinator?
