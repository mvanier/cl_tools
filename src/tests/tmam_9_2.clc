;;| == Non-computational solution
;;|
;;| Given conditions C1 and C2 (existence of B and M),
;;| there is at least one combinator X which is its own fixpoint i.e.
;;|
;;|   exists X: XX = X
;;|
;;| === Proof
;;|
;;| Assuming conditions C1 and C2, by theorem 1 all combinators have fixpoints.
;;| Therefore, the combinator M has a fixpoint.  Therefore: 
;;|
;;|   exists R: MR = R 
;;|
;;| But by definition of M, MR = RR. Therefore R = RR. QED.
