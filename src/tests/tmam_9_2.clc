;;| == Non-computational solution
;;|
;;| Given conditions C1 and C2 (existence of B and M),
;;| there is at least one combinator X which is its own fixpoint i.e.
;;|
;;|   exists X: (X X) = X
;;|
;;| === Proof
;;|
;;| Assuming conditions C1 and C2, by problem 1 all combinators have fixpoints.
;;| Therefore, the combinator M has a fixpoint.  Therefore: 
;;|
;;|   exists R: (M R) = R 
;;|
;;| But by definition of M, (M R) = (R R). Therefore R = (R R). QED.
;;|
;;| == Computational solution
;;|
;;| To generate the fixpoint of M, compute F = (M (B M M)).
;;|

def F (M (B M M))

;;| Now (M F) = (F F) and also (M F) = F, so F = (F F).
;;|

F :c :ss 5
;;|
(F F) :c :ss 2 :sc F
;;|
;;| So F = (F F). QED.
