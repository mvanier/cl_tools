;; TMAM: Chapter 9, Problem 1.

;; Definitions:
;; B x y z = x (y z)
;; M x = x x

;; Problem:
;; Given the combinators B and M, for an arbitrary combinator x,
;; find F, the fixpoint of x, such that x F = F.

#trace_on
(M (B x M)) ;; = F
;; --> ((B x M) (B x M))
;; --> (B x M (B x M))
;; --> (x (M (B x M)))
;; --> (x F)
;; QED

;; NOTE: The expression F = (M (B x M)) diverges, so it is problematic to say
;; that x F = F.  This is a strange definition of "equality".
;; It's kind of like saying that 1 + infinity = infinity.
