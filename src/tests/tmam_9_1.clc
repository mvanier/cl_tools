;; TMAM: Chapter 9, Problem 1.

;; Note that a precise statement of the problem in the form of a
;; combinatory logic problem is as follows:
;; >>> Given the combinators B and M, for an arbitrary combinator x,
;; >>> find the fixpoint of x F such that x F = F.
;; We prove the reverse: that F = x F.

#trace_on
(M (B x M)) ;; = F
;; --> ((B x M) (B x M))
;; --> (B x M (B x M))
;; --> (x (M (B x M)))
;; --> (x F)
