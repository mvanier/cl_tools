To Mock a Mockingbird: solutions
================================

== C1: Composition condition

For any two combinators A and B, the composition of A and B ([A o B],
also written as [\x.A(Bx)]) exists.


== C2: Mockingbird condition

There exists a combinator M such that [forall x: Mx = xx].


== Problem 9.1

Given conditions C1 and C2, every combinator P has a fixpoint i.e. 

  forall P: exists x: Px = x

>> Proof:

Consider an arbitrary combinator P.  

  let Q = M (P o M)  
  
Simplify Q:

  Q = M (P o M)  
    = (P o M) (P o M)  
    = P (M (P o M))  
    = PQ

Therefore PQ = Q.
Therefore Q is a fixpoint of P. QED.


== Problem 9.2

Given conditions C1 and C2, there is at least one combinator X which is its own
fixpoint i.e.

  exists X: XX = X

>> Proof:

Assuming conditions C1 and C2, by theorem 1 all combinators have fixpoints.
Therefore, the combinator M has a fixpoint.  Therefore: 

  exists R: MR = R 

But by definition of M, MR = RR. Therefore R = RR. QED.
