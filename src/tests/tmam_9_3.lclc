Smullyan, _To Mock A Mockingbird_: Chapter 9, Problem 3.

== Problem

Given the B combinator and a combinator A with the property

  forall X . exists c . (A c) = (X c)

(but no M combinator), then

  forall X . exists y . (X y) = y

== Solution

  Pick a combinator X.
  Find Y st (X Y) = Y.
  Consider (B X A).
  Then exists R st A R = (B X A) R = (X (A R))
  Let Y = (A R).
  Then Y = (X Y).  QED.

== Bonus question

Is it true that

  forall X . exists c . (M X) = (X c)

?

  (M X) = (X X) so c = X and the answer is yes.

So if M exists then M is the A combinator required for this problem.
