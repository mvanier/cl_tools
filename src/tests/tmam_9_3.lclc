Smullyan, _To Mock A Mockingbird_: Chapter 9, Problem 3.

== Problem

Given the B combinator and a combinator A with the property

  forall X . exists c . (A c) = (X c)

(but no M combinator), then

  forall X . exists y . (X y) = y

== Solution

Pick a combinator x.
Find y st (x y) = y.
Consider w = (B x A).
-> exists r st (A r) = (w r).  Set r = r'.
-> (A r') = (w r').
-> (A r') = ((B x A) r') = (B x A r') = (x (A r'))
Let y = (A r').
Then y = (x y).  QED.

== Bonus question

Is it true that

  forall x . exists c . (M x) = (x c)

?

  (M x) = (x x) so c = x and the answer is yes.

So if M exists then M is the A combinator required for this problem.
Therefore, problem 1 is a special case of problem 3 with A = M.
