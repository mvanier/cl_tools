Smullyan, _To Mock A Mockingbird_: Chapter 9, Problem 1.

Definitions:
(B x y z) = (x (y z))
(M x) = (x x)

Problem:
Given the combinators B and M, for an arbitrary combinator x,
find F, the fixpoint of x, such that (x F) = F.

> def F (M (B x M))
> F :c :ss 3

> (x F) :c :s

So x = (x F). QED.

NOTE: The expression F = (M (B x M)) diverges, so it is problematic
to say that (x F) = F.  This is a strange definition of "equality".
It's kind of like saying that 1 + infinity = infinity.
