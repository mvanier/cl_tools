(** Source code locations. *)

(** Type of locations in a source code file or string.
    Locations are a range of positions between
    (start_line, start_char) and (end_line, end_char) inclusive.
    Lines and characters use 1-indexing, as do most editors.
    The filename field is blank for interactive use. *)

(** Get a loc from two locs. 
    The loc has the same filename as the two input locs,
    The (start_line, start_char) from the first input loc,
    and the (end_line, end_char) from the second input loc.
    Raise an exception if the filenames are different or
    if the first loc doesn't come strictly before the second. *)
