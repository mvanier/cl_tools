# TODO for clc2

## Documentation

I need a definitive list of commands and syntax.

## lambda conversions

* Parsing

```
#convert ski [\f g x -> f x (g x)]
--> S
```

* Conversions

In `convert.ml`.

## Archive the old CLC, make clc2 the definitive one.

Also merge this branch with the main branch.
