## Commands

A command to print the working expression.

```
#w;
```

This is useful in conjunction with stepping.

## Verbosity

Need a way to display definitions for use in literate programs.
Also need a way of turning this display on or off.

```
#display_def ON;
#display_def OFF;
```

Of course, it will be off by default.

## lambda conversions
