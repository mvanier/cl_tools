// Problems from chapter 9 of Smullyan's "To Mock a Mockingbird".

*** PROBLEM 1 ***

Definitions:

def B x y z) = x (y z);
def M x = x x;

Problem:

Given the combinators B and M, for an arbitrary combinator x,
find F, the fixpoint of x, such that `x (F x) = F x`
(Smullyan says `F` where we say `F x`;
it's easier to work with `F` as a function.)

Solution:

def F x = M (B x M);
};

// B and M are built-in.
def F x = M (B x M);

#{F x};
F x;
#s;
#s;
#s;
#{= x (F x)};
#{QED};
