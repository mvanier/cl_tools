Smullyan, _To Mock A Mockingbird_: Chapter 9, Problem 9.

== Definitions

ego(X) = (X X) = X.              ; ego = egocentric
hego(X) = forall x . (X x) = X.  ; hego = hopelessly egocentric

== Problem

Given:
  Conditions C1 and C2 (exists B, M).
  exists K.

Prove:

  exists X . hego(X).

== Solution

Assume exists X' . K X' = X' (fixpoint of K).
Then hego(X') since (X' x) = (K X' x) = X'.
We can also find X':

> def X' (M (B K M))
> (X' x)
> :c :ss 4
  = X'

QED.
